# __Nashville Investment Project__ 
## Purpose
* The purpose of this project is to develop a data-driven solution for a real estate company seeking to invest in the Nashville area. Through tasks including data cleansing, model building, evaluation, and recommendation, the aim is to create a predictive model that accurately assesses property values and identifies instances of overpricing or underpricing. By comparing various modeling techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boost, and neural network, the project seeks to determine the most suitable approach for the problem at hand.
* Additionally, exploration of ensemble modeling techniques aims to enhance predictive accuracy and robustness. Ultimately, the project aims to provide actionable insights to the real estate company, enabling them to make informed investment decisions and maximize returns in the dynamic Nashville real estate market.
